# BlockchainledgerSynchronizer

## Description

A decentralized ledger framework utilizing a novel sharding architecture with asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus, enabling high-throughput transactions and adaptive scalability for IoT and edge computing applications.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for a Blockchain Ledger Synchronizer software project:
- "Synchronizes ledger states across multiple blockchain networks using a Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithm",
- "Utilizes a modular architecture to support hotswappable ledger implementations for different blockchain protocols",
- "Performs realtime transaction validation and conflict resolution using a probabilistic verification engine",
- "Provides automated ledger pruning and compaction to minimize storage requirements",
- "Offers configurable ledger indexing and caching for optimized query performance",
- "Supports secure multiparty computation for private ledger synchronization",
- "Includes a builtin ledger auditor for detecting and reporting inconsistencies and anomalies"
## Installation

```bash
pip install blockchainledgersynchronizer
```

## Usage

```python
from blockchainledgersynchronizer import BlockchainledgerSynchronizer

# Initialize
app = BlockchainledgerSynchronizer()

# Run
app.run()
```
